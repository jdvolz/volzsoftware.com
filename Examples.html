			<h3>A Memory Aid for People Who Like Funny Sentences</h3>
			<p>Volz Software recently completed an online application intended to aid college students in remembering collections 
			of words using mnemonics.  It is also good for making unexpected sentences.  You can see an example here:
			<a href="http://www.CheatToBeat.com/words.php">CheatToBeat.com</a>  For this project we completed all the 
			design as well as the programming using a mixture of PHP, Javascript, HTML, CSS and Ruby*.  
			</p>
			<p>*The Ruby was for command line tools to upkeep the site.  Ruby is suprisingly easy to 
			distribute to a Windows machine using <a href="http://www.erikveen.dds.nl/rubyscript2exe/">RubyScript2Exe</a>.</p>

			<h3>A Local Advertising System for Fantastic Sams</h3>
			<p>In conjunction with Admatrix, an advertising company, Volz Software developed a Windows based templating system 
			for the creation and distribution of advertisements.  This system is currently in use by Fantastic Sams, reaching 
			all of their 1,400 stores across the United States.

			<h3>A Reporting System for a Mortgage Broker</h3>		
			<p>Volz Software is currently working with a mortgage brokerage company to streamline their internal reporting processes, as well as to 
			consolidate their various business functions into a single platform.  We are just starting the testing phase of this project, but it looks like 
			the project is going to grow because they like what they can do with their own customer software.  The first phase of this project required 
			the creation of a data base driven software product that would track various entities within their business.  			
			</p>
			<p>As time is always of the essence this project was streamlined to include only the entities and fields that were absolutely necessary in 
			the first of at least 3 phases.  The focus was to get to the point where particular reports could be generated through the software (previously, they were 
			generated by hand, taking 4 days at the end of each month).  Including the data base design, software front end coding, writing a 
			custom reporting engine that outputs in both Excel and HTML (required by business requirements and time constraints), and testing, this project 
			has taken about 3 weeks to reach beta.  Having now reached beta with this project, the next iteration of this type and size of project would 
			only take half that time.</p>
			<p> Here are some screen shots to give 
			a taste of the style of work Volz Software does:

			<h3>Volz Software's Application Framework</h3>		
			<p>		This is a data base driven application framework and code 
						generator. Code named "Code Gen" this program is capable of producing the backbone
						code needed for data base driven programs. This helps 
						us to be able to provide affordable custom software to 
						small businesses.
			<p><b>*Update*</b>  The Code Gen project has grown and adapted as customers have needed additional functionality.  
			Porting the software to the .NET v2.0 framework was also a big improvement as the framework could take advantage of 
			several of the new features in v2.0.  It has also garnered a companion program (named Code Merc) that can be used for general code manipulation, 
			further descreasing the time to market for custom solutions and increasing the value provided by Volz Software to its customers.

			<h3>EZ Coordinator</h3>		
			<p>		Volz Software worked with MSGI to produce a real estate 
						transaction management software application. Volz Software provided the 
						architectural design, graphical user interface design, and the data base 
						schema. See screen shots at <a href="http://www.ezcoordinator.com">www.ezcoordinator.com</a>.

			<h3>American Financial Services</h3>		
			<p>We provided VBA Excel programming to produce mortgage rate 
						sheets. Volz Software also provided a custom Java program to preprocess third 
						party data so that it could be transferred to the rate sheets.
